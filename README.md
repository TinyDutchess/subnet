# Subnet

The benefits of subnetting a network vary with each deployment scenario. Allocating address space efficiently is necessary in large companies and the Internet using CIDR. Subnet network enhances routing efficiency and simplifies the network management when the company network is controlled by different company administrators. Subnets are constructed in a hierarchical architecture by partitioning a companyâ€™s network address space into a tree-like routing structure.

If the network prefixes of the source and destination hosts differ, the subnetwork permits the selective routing of IP packets across gateway computers, called routers in multiple networks. Otherwise, the packets will be sent to a target host on the local network. The routers constitute the borders and manage the traffic between the subnets. Each subnet is served by a default router, and consists of Ethernet segments interconnected by network switches.
