# Subnet

The benefits of subnetting a network vary with each deployment scenario. Allocating address space efficiently is necessary in large companies and the Internet using CIDR. Subnet network enhances routing efficiency and simplifies the network management when the company network is controlled by different company administrators. Subnets are constructed in a hierarchical architecture by partitioning a companyâ€™s network address space into a tree-like routing structure.

This logical addressing structure permits the selective routing of IP packets across multiple networks via special gateway computers, called routers, to a destination host if the network prefixes of origination and destination hosts differ, or sent directly to a target host on the local network if they are the same. Routers constitute logical or physical borders between the subnets, and manage traffic between them. Each subnet is served by a designated default router, but may consist internally of multiple physical Ethernet segments interconnected by network switches or network bridges.
